# What is cloud computing? (image, maybe)

-
The practice of using a network of remote servers hosted on the Internet to store, manage, and process data, rather than a local server or a personal computer

-
As simple as pooling your stuff together for your own access, private cloud

-
## Cloud Computing Models

* Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) - basic building blocks for cloud IT (VPC, EC2, EBS)
* Platform as a Service (PaaS) - AWS manages the underlying infrastructure (hardware and OS - RDS)
* Software as Service (SaaS) - Complete Product run by the service provider. End-user applications (web email, office 365, salesforce)
